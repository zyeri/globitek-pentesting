# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection - Input to the `id` parameter in the url isn't sanitized

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation - Session variables can be modified to hijack another users' session


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username enumeration - Entering correct usernames without a correct password will result in an error message confirming the username is valid

Vulnerability #2: Cross-site scripting (XSS) - Contact form input isn't escaped before being entered into the database


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference - No check is made to determine whether the profile for the `id` in the GET request should be displayed or result in an error of some kind, so profiles not intended to be public yet are displayed 

Vulnerability #2: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Honestly have no idea how this one works. I had found all the others and this was the last one left, so it had to be this. 


## Notes

N/A.
